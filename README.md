Hello! I’m Diogo Silva 👋 
I’m interested in gaming, internet culture and all the tech/science innovations that change our reality for the better... at least make it more weird!
🌱 I’m currently learning python so that I can be a Python Developer.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all the projects that can improve skills and learn new stuff
