Hello! I’m Diogo Silva 👋  
I've always been a very curious person ranging from how the age of the universe was determined to why fast food fries taste so good?!  
🌱 I’m currently learning python so that I can be a Python Developer.  
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all the projects that can improve my skills and help me learn new stuff.  
You can reach me using my personal email: diogomail97@gmail.com
