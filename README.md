Hello! I’m Diogo Silva 👋 Quick fact about me, I've always been a very curious person ranging from how the age of the universe was determined to why fast food fries taste so good?! Long time tech and gaming enthusiast.  
  
🌱 I’m currently learning python so that I can become a Python Developer.  
🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on all the projects that can improve my skills and help me learn new stuff.  
📬 You can reach me using my personal email: diogomail97@gmail.com
